<p>Hello i am going to work on GCompris, a complete education suite under KDE this summer. and i am very excited about it. There are three parts that brought me here.</p>

<h2>
<a id="mentors" class="anchor" href="#mentors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Mentors</h2>

<p>I found one of the best mentors <strong>bruno coudoin</strong> (bdoin) and <strong>johnny jazeix</strong> (JohnnyJ), who are according to me best mentors i have ever seen ( as much as i know from discussion with my friends about their mentoring organizations). I am lucky to work under their guidance. They always come up with innovative ideas and caress there dream GCompris.</p>

<h2>
<a id="people-behind-it" class="anchor" href="#people-behind-it" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>People behind it</h2>

<p><strong>Srishti sethi</strong> (SrishAkaTux), GSoCer,GCompris and <strong>shashikant vaishnav</strong> (shashitechno) GSoCer,moodle are most influential seniors i have came across. I remember the talks by shashikant boss about open source and their evening tea sessions with me, that enthusiasm that they carried is what i want to carry forward. Srishti sethi is the single person whom i have seen always positive about everything. From the day when boss said siddhesh, why don't you speak up about your ideas and views, i have grown up from a shy one to a mature one.</p>

<p>Conf.kde.in and pradeepto are also an milestone to this journey. want to thank pradeepto specially for making everyone believe in themselves. i can still hear your words echoing. ;) </p>

<p>Seeing the happiness of them after getting into GSoC was one of the memorable feeling i have ever had. Thank you for being angles :)</p>

<h2>
<a id="my-friends" class="anchor" href="#my-friends" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>My friends</h2>

<p><strong>Richa rupela</strong> and <strong>Ayush sharma</strong>, for always standing by my side during the period of applying for gcompris. Loved to discuss the activities and ideas with them the most, they are always the first to know if i am working well or not, also the first one to boost my moral if i feel a bit off. special thanks to you guys, we are more than friends and we will believe in ourselves no matter what :)</p>

<p>The thank you list can't be said complete without mentioning Kamlesh kumar, Dinesh bhadana, monish solanki and rakesh kumar verma for providing their valuable feedback and support throughout the period.</p>

<h2>
<a id="my-project" class="anchor" href="#my-project" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>My project</h2>

<p>Looking forward to an awesome summer, where i will create <strong>reading and computer learning activities</strong> for GCompris. These will focus on learning while play for kids under age group 2 to 10. </p>

<p>Learning how to program is like learning any other language. The difference, of course, is that
programming can be much more powerful. With just a computer, kids can use the skills they learn to
build something that might change the world.</p>

<p>Language learning in particular require long and complex process to learn. Overall, reading methods
must be resilient to the vicissitudes of implementation. Books alone are not sufficient to keep children's
interested in languages. A game which will be fun to play for them can be a good early start for
learning for every children.</p>

<p>Looking forward to make these activities as intuitive and sublime as i can.</p>

<p>PS : Here is a link to my <a href="https://github.com/siddhism/GSoCProposal/blob/master/proposal_gcompris.pdf">proposal</a></p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
